# Per-Frame Pipeline

This document describes what happens each frame in the game loop, covering
the interaction between GDScript (`main.gd`, `tree_renderer.gd`), the
GDExtension bridge (`sim_bridge.rs`), and the background mesh generation
workers. Understanding this pipeline is essential for reasoning about
concurrency safety and frame budgets.

## Call sequence

Every frame, GDScript calls into the Rust bridge in this order:

```
GDScript main loop (every frame)
│
├─ 1. frame_update(delta)
│     │
│     ├─ Single-player: LocalRelay.update() → session.process(AdvanceTo)
│     │   → SimState::step() advances tick, processes events, mutates world
│     │
│     └─ Multiplayer: poll_network() → try_recv() inbox (non-blocking)
│         → session.process(SimCommand) for each received command
│         → session.process(AdvanceTo) to advance to the turn's target tick
│         → SimState::step() advances tick, processes events, mutates world
│
├─ 2. tree_renderer.refresh()
│     │
│     ├─ 2a. update_world_mesh()
│     │     Drains dirty_voxels from VoxelWorld (render-only metadata).
│     │     Marks affected chunks + neighbors as dirty in MeshCache.
│     │     Submits visible dirty chunks for background re-generation
│     │     via ChunkNeighborhood extraction (quick voxel copy).
│     │
│     ├─ 2a'. _apply_draw_distance()
│     │     Reads draw_distance from GameConfig; updates the bridge if
│     │     the value changed (e.g., via settings panel).
│     │
│     ├─ 2b. update_visibility(cam_pos, frustum)
│     │     │
│     │     ├─ drain_completed(): polls mpsc channel for finished meshes
│     │     │   from background workers. Inserts into cache, populates
│     │     │   chunks_generated delta list. Discards stale results
│     │     │   (sim_tick < cached version).
│     │     │
│     │     ├─ Culling pass: classifies chunks as visible (in frustum),
│     │     │   shadow-only (in shadow volume), or hidden. Uses MegaChunk
│     │     │   spatial hierarchy for coarse pass, then per-chunk AABBs.
│     │     │
│     │     ├─ Submission: for each newly-visible chunk without a cached
│     │     │   mesh (and not already in-flight), extracts a
│     │     │   ChunkNeighborhood (quick copy of the chunk's voxels plus
│     │     │   a 2-voxel border, along with any grassless dirt coords in
│     │     │   the region) and inserts it into the priority work queue.
│     │     │   Workers pick the closest-to-camera chunk when ready. All
│     │     │   pending chunks are submitted (no per-frame cap).
│     │     │
│     │     ├─ Delta lists: computes show/hide/shadow transitions by
│     │     │   diffing old vs new visible/shadow sets.
│     │     │
│     │     └─ LRU eviction: if over memory budget, evicts least-recently-
│     │         accessed non-visible chunks.
│     │
│     ├─ 2c. Process delta lists (GDScript)
│     │     Creates MeshInstance3D nodes for generated chunks.
│     │     Toggles .visible and cast_shadow for show/hide/shadow transitions.
│     │     Frees MeshInstance3D nodes for evicted chunks.
│     │     Builds ArrayMesh from cached ChunkMesh data (main thread).
│     │
│     └─ 2d. refresh_fruit()
│           Updates billboarded Sprite3D nodes for fruit voxels.
│
└─ 3. (other per-frame work: UI, input, creature rendering, etc.)
```

## Concurrency model

All numbered steps above are **sequential on the main thread**. There is no
overlap between sim advance (step 1) and mesh operations (step 2). This is
true in both single-player and multiplayer modes.

Background mesh generation runs on **long-lived worker threads** that pull
work from a shared priority queue (`MeshWorkQueue`). Each worker loops:
lock the queue, find the pending chunk closest to the current camera
position, remove it, unlock, generate the mesh, send the result back via
an mpsc channel.

Workers operate on owned `ChunkNeighborhood` snapshots — they do not hold
references to `VoxelWorld` or any other shared state. The snapshot is
extracted on the main thread during steps 2a (dirty re-generation) and 2b
(first-time generation of newly-visible chunks). Each extraction copies
the chunk's 16x16x16 voxels plus a 2-voxel border (~20x20x20 = 8000
voxels), then the copy is inserted into the queue.

This means:
- **Minimal locking.** The main thread holds the queue lock briefly to
  insert work and update the camera position. Workers hold it briefly to
  scan pending entries and pop the closest one. The expensive mesh
  generation happens entirely outside the lock. There is no concurrent
  access to `VoxelWorld`.
- **Dynamic prioritization.** The camera position stored in the queue is
  updated each frame. Workers always pick the chunk closest to the
  *current* camera, not where it was when the chunk was submitted. This
  ensures nearby chunks (e.g., grass turning to dirt from grazing) are
  processed before distant ones.
- **Superseding.** If a chunk is re-submitted while still in the queue
  (not yet picked up by a worker), the new `ChunkNeighborhood` replaces
  the old one. This avoids wasted mesh generation when a chunk changes
  multiple times before any worker gets to it.
- **Staleness is self-correcting.** A worker's snapshot may be several
  frames old if mesh generation takes longer than one frame. If the world
  changes while a mesh is being generated, the dirty-voxel mechanism marks
  the chunk for re-generation. When the stale result arrives it is inserted
  normally, then the dirty flag triggers a fresh submission on the next
  frame.
- **Freshness checks prevent stale overwrites.** Each `ChunkNeighborhood`
  carries the `sim_tick` at extraction time. When a result arrives, it is
  discarded if a newer version is already cached (two results for the same
  chunk raced and the newer one won).
