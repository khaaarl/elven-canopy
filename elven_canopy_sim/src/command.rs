// Commands that mutate simulation state.
//
// All external mutations to the simulation go through `SimCommand`. This is
// the only way outside code can change sim state — the sim is a pure function
// `(state, commands) -> (new_state, events)`, and commands are the input.
//
// The full flow for a player action:
//   GDScript UI → `sim_bridge.rs` (gdext) → constructs a `SimCommand` →
//   `SimState::step()` in `sim.rs` processes it.
//
// In multiplayer (future), commands are broadcast to all peers, canonically
// ordered by tick, then applied — guaranteeing identical state.
//
// A `SimCommand` carries a `player_id`, a `tick` (when to apply), and a
// `SimAction` enum. Current actions:
// - `DesignateBuild` — validate and create a platform blueprint (see `blueprint.rs`).
// - `DesignateBuilding` — validate and create a building blueprint with per-face
//   layout (see `building.rs`).
// - `DesignateCarve` — validate and create a carve blueprint that removes solid
//   voxels to Air (the inverse of construction).
// - `CancelBuild` — remove a blueprint by ProjectId.
// - `SetTaskPriority` — build system (placeholder, not yet wired).
// - `SpawnCreature` — place a creature of any species at a voxel position.
// - `CreateTask` — create a task at a voxel position (see `task.rs` for
//   `TaskKind`). The handler in `sim.rs` snaps the position to the nearest
//   nav node.
// - `RenameStructure` — set or clear a completed structure's user-editable name.
// - `DesignateLadder` — place a wood or rope ladder at an anchor position.
// - `FurnishStructure` — begin furnishing a completed building (e.g. Dormitory).
// - `AssignHome` — assign a creature to a home structure, or unassign.
// - `SetLogisticsPriority` — enable/disable logistics on a building and set
//   its pull priority (higher = served first).
// - `SetLogisticsWants` — set which items and quantities a building wants
//   hauled to it. The `LogisticsHeartbeat` creates `Haul` tasks to fill these.
// - `SetCookingConfig` — enable/disable cooking on a kitchen and set the
//   bread production target.
// - `SetCreatureFood` — directly set a creature's food value (initial spawning).
// - `SetCreatureRest` — directly set a creature's rest value (initial spawning).
// - `AddCreatureItem` — add items to a creature's inventory.
// - `AddGroundPileItem` — add items to a ground pile (creating it if needed).
// - `DebugNotification` — create a debug notification for testing.
// - `SetWorkshopConfig` — enable/disable a workshop and set which recipe IDs
//   it should produce. Recomputes logistics wants from recipe inputs.
// - `DiscoverCiv` — a civ becomes aware of another civ, creating a
//   CivRelationship row. No-op if already aware.
// - `SetCivOpinion` — update a civ's opinion of another civ. No-op if
//   unaware (no CivRelationship row exists).
// - `DebugKillCreature` — kill a creature immediately (debug/testing).
// - `DamageCreature` — reduce a creature's HP. Death at 0 HP.
// - `HealCreature` — restore a creature's HP (clamped to hp_max, no-op on dead).
//
// See also: `sim.rs` for `process_command()` which dispatches these,
// `task.rs` for `TaskKind`, `types.rs` for the ID and enum types used here,
// `sim_bridge.rs` (in the gdext crate) for the GDScript-facing wrappers.
//
// **Critical constraint: determinism.** Commands are the sole external input
// to the sim. Internal state changes come from scheduled events (see
// `event.rs`).
