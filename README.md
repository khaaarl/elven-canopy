A Dwarf Fortress-inspired simulation game set in a forest of enormous trees. You are a tree spirit who forms a symbiotic relationship with a village of elves — they sing to you and you grow platforms, walkways, and structures from your trunk and branches. Happy elves generate mana, mana fuels growth, and growth keeps elves happy.

## Playing the game

Download the latest build for your platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/khaaarl/elven-canopy/releases). Builds are available for Windows, Linux, macOS, and Android.

> **Note:** These builds are not code-signed or notarized. Your OS may show a warning when you try to run them.
> - **Windows:** "Windows protected your PC" — click *More info* then *Run anyway*.
> - **macOS:** "can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer" — right-click the app, choose *Open*, then click *Open* in the dialog. Alternatively, run `xattr -cr "Elven Canopy.app"` in Terminal.
> - **Linux:** You may need to `chmod +x` the binary after extracting.

## Development setup

The game uses **Godot 4.6** for rendering and UI, with all simulation logic written in **Rust** and bridged via GDExtension. You'll need three things installed: Python 3, Rust, and Godot.

### 1. Python 3

The build script (`scripts/build.py`) requires Python 3.8+ with no external dependencies.

| Platform | Install |
|----------|---------|
| **Linux** | Usually pre-installed. Check with `python3 --version`. If missing: `sudo apt install python3` (Debian/Ubuntu) or equivalent. |
| **macOS** | Usually pre-installed on recent versions. Otherwise: `brew install python3` |
| **Windows** | Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or install via `winget install Python.Python.3`. Make sure "Add to PATH" is checked during install. |

### 2. Rust

Install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/):

```bash
# Linux / macOS
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Windows — download and run rustup-init.exe from https://rustup.rs/
```

The project uses Rust edition 2024, which requires Rust 1.85+. After installing, verify with `rustc --version`.

### 3. Godot 4.6

Download **Godot 4.6** (standard build, not .NET) from [godotengine.org](https://godotengine.org/download/).

The Godot binary needs to be on your `PATH` so the build script can find it. It looks for `godot-4`, `godot4`, or `godot` in that order.

| Platform | Typical setup |
|----------|---------------|
| **Linux** | Package managers often install as `godot-4`. Snap: `sudo snap install godot-4`. Or extract the downloaded binary somewhere on your PATH. |
| **macOS** | `brew install --cask godot` puts it on your PATH. Or extract the app and symlink the binary. |
| **Windows** | The download is a standalone `.exe` with a long name like `Godot_v4.6.1-stable_win64.exe`. Create a directory (e.g., `C:\Tools\Godot`), copy the exe there, rename it to `godot.exe`, and add that directory to your PATH. Alternatively, `scoop install godot` handles all of this automatically. |

### 4. C++ build dependencies (for the LLM crate)

The `elven_canopy_llm` crate wraps llama.cpp, which is compiled from C++ source during the Rust build. This requires CMake, a C++ compiler, LLVM/Clang (for bindgen FFI generation), and GPU SDK headers for hardware-accelerated inference.

**GPU backends:** The build automatically selects the right GPU backend for each platform — Vulkan on Linux/Windows, Metal on macOS. Metal support is built into macOS (no extra install). Vulkan requires SDK headers at build time (see below). At runtime, if no compatible GPU is found, llama.cpp falls back to CPU automatically.

**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**

```bash
sudo apt install cmake libclang-dev libvulkan-dev glslang-tools
# On Ubuntu 22.04 and older, vulkan-headers is a separate package:
sudo apt install vulkan-headers 2>/dev/null || true

# glslc (Vulkan shader compiler) is not in standard Ubuntu packages.
# Install from the LunarG Vulkan SDK repository:
wget -qO- https://packages.lunarg.com/lunarg-signing-key-pub.asc | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/lunarg.asc
sudo wget -qO /etc/apt/sources.list.d/lunarg-vulkan-noble.list https://packages.lunarg.com/vulkan/lunarg-vulkan-noble.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y shaderc
```

A C++ compiler (`g++`) is typically already installed. If not: `sudo apt install build-essential`.

**macOS:**

CMake and Clang are provided by Xcode Command Line Tools, which you likely already have if you've installed Rust or Homebrew. If not:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

If CMake is missing after that: `brew install cmake`.

No extra GPU SDK is needed — Metal is built into macOS and the Xcode tools.

**Windows:**

Four things are needed:

1. **Visual Studio Build Tools 2022** (provides the MSVC C++ compiler and linker):
   ```
   winget install Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools
   ```
   When the Visual Studio Installer opens, select the **"Desktop development with C++"** workload. Make sure **"MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools"** and a **Windows SDK** are checked within it.

2. **CMake** (usually included with the Build Tools if you selected the C++ workload above). Verify with `cmake --version`. If missing: `winget install Kitware.CMake`.

3. **LLVM** (provides libclang for bindgen):
   ```
   winget install LLVM.LLVM
   ```
   After installation, set the `LIBCLANG_PATH` environment variable to the LLVM bin directory (typically `C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin`).

4. **Vulkan SDK** (provides headers and shader compiler for GPU inference):
   Download and install from [vulkan.lunarg.com](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home). The installer sets `VULKAN_SDK` automatically. Verify with `echo %VULKAN_SDK%`.

**Important:** On Windows, run builds from the **"x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022"** (search Start menu) so that the MSVC compiler and linker are on PATH. Building from a regular terminal or PowerShell will fail with `link.exe not found`.

> **Note:** If you previously had Visual Studio 2017 installed, uninstall it — CMake may find the old toolchain first, which lacks C++17 support required by llama.cpp.

> **Note:** On Windows, the build script automatically places Cargo's target directory at `C:\ct` instead of the project's `target/` subdirectory. This is required because MSVC's `cl.exe` does not support paths longer than 260 characters, and the llama.cpp Vulkan shader build generates deeply nested paths that exceed this limit. You can override this with the `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` environment variable.

The first build compiles llama.cpp from source, which takes several minutes. Subsequent builds are cached.

### 5. Clone and build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/khaaarl/elven-canopy.git
cd elven-canopy

# Build the Rust GDExtension library (debug mode)
python3 scripts/build.py

# Build and launch the game
python3 scripts/build.py run
```

On Windows, use `python` or `py` instead of `python3` if that's how your Python is installed:

```
py scripts\build.py run
```

The first build compiles the Godot GDExtension bindings and llama.cpp from C++ source, which takes several minutes. Subsequent builds are incremental and much faster.

### Build commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `python3 scripts/build.py` | Debug build |
| `python3 scripts/build.py release` | Release (optimized) build |
| `python3 scripts/build.py run` | Debug build + launch |
| `python3 scripts/build.py run-branch NAME` | Fetch, checkout branch, sync, build + launch |
| `python3 scripts/build.py test` | Run all Rust and GDScript tests |
| `python3 scripts/build.py quicktest` | Test only crates changed vs main |
| `python3 scripts/build.py gdtest` | Run GDScript unit tests only |
| `python3 scripts/build.py check` | Run formatters, linters, and checks |
| `python3 scripts/build.py relay` | Optimized standalone relay server binary |
| `python3 scripts/build.py coverage` | Generate HTML code coverage report |

### Opening in the Godot editor

After building at least once (so the GDExtension library exists), open the Godot editor and import the `godot/` directory as a project. The build script creates a `godot/target` symlink pointing to the Cargo output directory — this is how Godot finds the compiled library.
